# Portfolio-Website-of-Soham-Das
A portfolio website for my friend [Soham Das](https://github.com/So-ham) created by me.

This is a "Neon-Themed" website, created by using Bootstrap4, jQuery, Vanilla JS and ofcourse HTML5 & CSS3. It's a fully responsive website which works perfectly fine in all devices.
